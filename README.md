# Discord-Ban-Bot
I needed a small Discord Bot to make Ban-votes possible for my Server.

I had a Discord Server where everyone was welcome and i though it would be a good idea to take away the ability to ban people from my mods.
But in the end after the first few trolls i decided to let all of my mods decide when and who to kick out of my Server with a voting System.
When more than half of my mods decided to say yes the person gets kicked out.

The Command for that vote is: !banvote @UserTag
(It is important to tag the User!)
You cant use this command if you dont have the mods role!

Dont forget to add your server specific role in the BanMember class and most important dont forget to import your Bot Token.
I wrote this bot specific for one Server, if you want to use it you need to add both of them! But you can change that of course.



You can create a Discord Bot via this link

To see your mods role id, you need to check the developer mode in your user settings

You can then right click on your mod role
